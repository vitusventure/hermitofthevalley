This year's One Page Dungeon contest opened on July 1st with the theme "And Still They Rise". I have always adored these in the past, and this year I may have my first try at submitting something. I have been practicing my OSR style dungeon drawing (with help from [Paths Peculiar](https://www.wistedt.net/tutorials/tutorial-dungeon-map/)). I have no idea if I will come up with something very usable, but I think it will be a fun process to try and take my basic drawings and put a bit more substance behind them.

Keep an eye here for more updates, also check out the official [One Page Dungeon](https://www.dungeoncontest.com/) site.
